            Tanjiro Kamado (竈門かまど 炭たん治じ郎ろう Kamado Tanjirō?) is the
            main protagonist of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. He is a Demon
            Slayer in the Demon Slayer Corps, who joined to find a remedy to
            turn his sister, Nezuko Kamado, back into a human and to hunt down
            and kill demons, and later swore to defeat Muzan Kibutsuji, the King
            of Demons, in order to prevent others from suffering the same fate
            as him. Tanjiro is a young boy of average height with fairly tanned
            skin and an athletic, muscular physique. He has ruffled, black hair
            with burgundy tips, combed back to expose his forehead, and wide,
            dark red eyes with white pupils that appear lighter around the lower
            section of his irises. He also has a scar on the top left of his
            forehead, first seen when his mother brought him to watch his father
            perform the Hinokami Kagura dance. The scar originally looked
            somewhat like a graze until his fight with the Hand Demon during
            Final Selection, after which it develops into a flame-like pattern
            as his Demon Slayer Mark. It is noted that his hands are visibly
            rougher for someone his age, as a result of his rigorous training
            under Sakonji Urokodaki. Tanjiro looks remarkably similar in
            appearance to his ancestor Sumiyoshi Kamado, possessing the same
            facial structure, eyes, and hairstyle as him, although Sumiyoshi's
            hair was longer, about shoulder-length and would be tied in a
            ponytail behind his head.

            Inosuke Hashibira (嘴はし平びら 伊い之の助すけ Hashibira Inosuke?)
            is one of the main characters of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba and
            along with Zenitsu Agatsuma, a traveling companion of Tanjiro Kamado
            and Nezuko Kamado. He is also a Demon Slayer in the Demon Slayer
            Corps. Inosuke is a young man of average height and pale complexion
            with an extremely toned and muscular build for his age. In sharp
            contrast to this, he has an incredibly pretty and feminine face,[3]
            with large, wide eyes that are framed by an array of long eyelashes,
            their irises a dark to soft pale green, thin eyebrows and what could
            be a small, well-mannered mouth. His thick, black hair reaches just
            past his shoulders, fading into blue at the tips and forming an
            unruly and uneven fringe that falls just above his eyes, puffing out
            before curving and thinning towards his forehead. Inosuke, in his
            unique fashion, has customized his Demon Slayer uniform to suit his
            personal style. His altered attire consists of baggy hakama pants in
            a dark gray-blue shade, secured at his hips with a thick belt
            adorned with fluffy brown deer fur.[4] Unlike his fellow companions,
            Inosuke forgoes wearing a haori. Instead of the customary leg-wraps,
            he opts for knee-high socks made from bear hide,[4] which serve as a
            base for the sandals he wears. Notably, his heels and toes are left
            exposed. However, the most distinctive aspect of his appearance is
            the gray, hollowed-out boar's head that he wears as a mask. Inosuke
            has modified the boar's head, altering the eyes to allow him to see
            while wearing it.[5]

            brown to gold and golden, forked eyebrows that sharply fade into a
            warm orange color. He has short, yellow hair of varying lengths,
            cutting off squarely at the ends where it fades to a darker orange
            color, that falls in front of his face in uneven bangs, loosely
            resembling a bowl cut. Before he became a Demon Slayer, Zenitsu's
            hair was originally black, but it turned the color it is currently
            when he was struck by lightning during his training.[2]

            sharp, stiletto nails with a base color of light pink and ombre
            fading to a red-pinkish color at the end where they point. Her hair
            is long, black, and wavy. It reaches just below her waist, turning a
            flame-orange color as it passes her elbows, and appears to be
            crimped into large, straight ridges, worn side-swept drastically to
            her left. She has soft-looking, pale pink eyes that appear a lighter
            color around the rims of their irises, slanted downward toward the
            sides of her face and framed by notably long eyelashes, the pupils
            of which can appear slit as she transforms. In the manga, Nezuko can
            sometimes be shown with more than one bow. According to Tanjiro
            Kamado, Nezuko was known as a great beauty in their home town.[4]

            Shinobu Kocho (胡こ蝶ちょう しのぶ Kochō Shinobu?) is a major
            supporting character of Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba. She is a
            Demon Slayer of the Demon Slayer Corps and the current Insect
            Hashira (蟲むし柱ばしら Mushi Bashira?).[2][3] Shinobu is also the
            younger sister of Kanae Kocho along with her adoptive younger sister
            Kanao Tsuyuri. After a demon killed her parents, Shinobu joined the
            Demon Slayer Corps along with her sister in order to protect others
            from suffering the same fate as her.Shinobu is a petite young woman
            with a slender build and a pale complexion. She has large eyes that
            lack pupils, only a haze of gradient purple, making her eyes appear
            similar to those of insects. She has medium black wavy hair that
            fades into dark purple at the ends, styled at the back of her head
            into a flat yakai-maki bun, fastened with a white, turquoise and
            light purple butterfly ornament. She has center-split, ear-length,
            voluminous curtain bangs that flow down to frame the sides of her
            face, with two slightly thinner chin-length locks of hair in front
            of her ears below them. She stands out among the more physically
            imposing Hashira due to her diminutive stature and small frame,
            which is later reinforced by her mentioning that she does not
            possess enough physical strength to decapitate a demon as the others
            do. According to Zenitsu, Shinobu is so cute, that she could make a
            living on her looks alone.Shinobu wears a dark purple standard Demon
            Slayer uniform with gold buttons, consisting of a dark-purple tinted
            straight-lined black jacket and matching colored tabi socks and
            hakama pants, tucked into white butterfly patterned Kyahan fading
            into pale turquoise then pink around her lower legs, fastened with
            white ribbons. Over her uniform, she wears a white haori that
            previously belonged to her older sister, which has a butterfly wing
            pattern that fades into a pale turquoise then pink color on the
            sleeves and hem which are cuffed with a black and white dotted trim.
            She wears white zōri sandals with purple straps for footwear, with a
            hidden blade in one of the heels.
